# Disk Scheduling Algorithm Visualization

An interactive visualization tool for demonstrating and comparing different disk scheduling algorithms. Supports three classic disk scheduling algorithms: FCFS (First Come First Serve), SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First), and SCAN (Elevator Algorithm).

## Features

- Intuitive disk head movement visualization
- Real-time display of seek time and current position
- Support for three classic disk scheduling algorithms:
  - FCFS (First Come First Serve)
  - SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
  - SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)
- Algorithm performance comparison table
- Detailed algorithm characteristics explanation
- Responsive design, mobile device support

## Usage

1. Set initial head position (0-199)
2. Input request queue (comma-separated numbers)
3. Select SCAN algorithm initial direction (Left/Right)
4. Click corresponding algorithm button to start demonstration
5. Use reset button to restart demonstration
6. View comparison table to understand performance differences between algorithms
